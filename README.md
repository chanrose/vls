## Problem: How to improve and enhance vehicle legality within organization?

## Proposed Solution:

To increase the efficiency of vehicle information for legality, Vehicle Legal
System is an app to help the organization’s administrators in managing the information regarding
the vehicle details such as vehicle models, greenbook, tax renewal, and the current owner detail
such as the owner’s id, name, residential address, and driver license.
Stakeholders involvement: as the organization’s administrator, it is very important to have a
complete detail of the vehicle inside the organization in case that there is any legal concern from
the government and other parties. The same way as it applies to the current owner of the vehicle.

## Specific Objectives:

Vehicle Legal System allows the administrators to create, view,
modify, and delete the vehicle’s information. As it also has another main component in which to
remind the administrator to pay attention to certain date intervals such as tax renewal or
insurance for example. Not just that, it also helps the users or guests to understand the
information regarding legality with the vehicle and also price estimation in regarding vehicle
ownership. Guard or special user is also implemented in which allows issuing a ticket system
when there is a parking issue among the organizations.
